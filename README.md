# MLOps Project


In this repo, we'll focus on the orchestration of a machine learning inference using AWS services and microservices architecture. The goal is to create a pipeline with GitHub Actions that will be triggered by a new file upload to an S3 bucket. The pipeline will then process the file and return the predictions in our web.
